the original kjv.xml that was the original source of kjv.json was found at

    https://code.google.com/archive/p/sspc-website/source/default/source?page=5
    under the entry: sspc-website/trunk/include/bibles/kjv.xml

the xml was converted to json via this python module:

    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/xmljson

using the BadgerFish convention.

the @name keys were converted to number using this regular expression:

    ("@name")(: [0-9]+,$)

and replaced with
    
    "number"\2

the "$" keys were replaced with "text"

all subsequent changes are tracked via version control.
